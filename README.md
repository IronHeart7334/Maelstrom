# Maelstrom
This is my first "mega program", as call it: The first programming project I've
poured countless hours of work into. I learned so much while making this game,
both about programming and game design in general.

TODO:
* use my application directory system from ARCDHWebAutomator
* make the game fun
* separate object deserialization from the classes themselves
* random campaign generator: Have the program chop up a Shakespere play and make
  characters and locations based off of that?
* do away with "Customization Points" system. Change to allow player to choose
  from sets of pre-generated content. Add "guidebooks" the player can use to
  look up info on enemies, actives, passives, and items to avoid info-dumping
  before every battle
