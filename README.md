# Maelstrom
This is my first "mega program", as call it: The first programming project I poured countless hours of work into. I learned so much while making this game, both about programming and game design in general. I was going to do a longer introduction, but I'm tired.

TODO:
* better logging
* better output
* use my application directory system from ARCDHWebAutomator
* make the game fun
* random campaign generator: Have the program chop up a Shakespere play and make characters and locations based off of that?
