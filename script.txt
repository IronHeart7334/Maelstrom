Origin Beaches: 
All heroes have to start somewhere 
Encounter! Rain Entity
Quick! Knock its hit points down to zero and escape!
Congradulations!
The Entity dissipates into a cloud of smoke

The Gravel Trail:
A rough path leads up from the beaches... 
The gravel crunches beneath your feet as you walk
Suddenly it starts to drizzle lightly
TIP: While it is raining, all characters will regain a little HP each turn
Congradulations!

The Stagnant Pools:
Alongside the path lie many puddles...
A puddle begins to ripple...
...and take form!
TIP: Higher level characters have better stats, but HP grows slowly
Congradulations!

Deluge:
The rain begins to pour...
Flashes of lightning...
...no longer distant!
You are far stronger than you appear...

The Rain Village:
Where peace and tranquility hang over like a fine mist

Forest Clearing:
A fresh coating of snow covers all the trees

The Hail Village:
